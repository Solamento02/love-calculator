# My love calculator
It's some silly app that my boyfriend asked me to do. Just some love calculator that makes up the percentagem of you crush. Also I added one command that you can put an exception of specific names, it is on the code. And about the icon app I'm gonna fix later </br>

If you want mess up with the code, when you extract the zip use this command on the folder to get the dependencies:
````
npm install
````
Since I used expo you run the command
```
npx expo start
```
Have fun!ðŸ˜‰
